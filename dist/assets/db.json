This even works for things like outfits or food restrictions.","In the work tab's manual priorities mode, 1 is first priority, while 4 is last priority.","Each colonists' mood is displayed in the background of their icon in the colonist bar at the top of the screen.","Shift-clicking the name of a work type in the Work tab changes settings for all colonists at once.","Right-clicking a number in the Work tab using manual priorities will reduce the priority instead of increasing it.","You can hold the alt key to show detailed information about a specific tile.","In a gunfight, always be behind cover! Right-click and drag to have your drafted fighters form a line.","Right-click and drag to have your drafted fighters form a line. Bunched-up targets are easy to hit!","Smoke totally prevents turrets from detecting targets, but people can still shoot with reduced accuracy.","When designing defences, assume enemies will get inside using drop pods or tunnels. Build internal defensive positions.","Foggy or rainy weather reduces the accuracy of ranged weapons.","You can analyze the chance a shot will hit by selecting the shooter and placing the mouse over the target.","Turrets explode when they take a lot of damage. Don't put them too close together, and don't put your people too close to them.","Some animals explode upon death. You can use transport pods to drop animals on enemies. Think about it.","If you need help in a fight, call your allies using the comms console.","Maddened animals will attack any human, including your enemies. You can use this.","EMP bursts will temporarily disable turrets and shields.","EMP bursts instantly break personal shields.","The hunter stealth stat reduces the chance of animal attacks. It is affected by the hunter's animals and shooting skills.","Animals are more likely to attack when harmed from close range. Long-range, slow-firing weapons are safest for hunting.","Entire herds of animals may attack you when you try to hunt them. Accept the risk before hunting, or choose weaker prey.","If you hunt boomrats and boomalopes when it's raining, their deaths won't cause forest fires.","Carefully-slaughtered animals yield more meat and leather than those who were killed violently.","Place the caravan hitching spot where you want your caravans to form up. It's usually best to place it near your storage areas.","During encounters away from home, you can place a caravan hitching spot to keep your animals from wandering.","Caravans move faster if they include rideable animals like horses, donkeys and dromedaries.","Smaller caravans get attacked less often because they're less visible.","Before forming a caravan, collect the items you want to send in a stockpile near your caravan hitching spot. This will make packing much faster.","If you have untrained animals in your caravan, you can split them into a separate caravan before attacking an enemy, to keep them out of the fight.","Don't forget to pack medicine on your caravans.","RimWorld is a story generator, not a skill test. A ruined colony is a dramatic tragedy, not a failure.","Some colonists are worse than useless. Bad allies are part of the challenge.","If you can't defend against a threat, make a caravan and run. You may lose your home, but your story can continue.","When you have more wealth, more powerful enemies attack. If you want the challenge to scale with time instead, select 'Wealth-independent progress mode' in the storyteller settings.","Avoid using stone for doors. They open very slowly, which wastes your colonists' time.","Put chairs in front of workbenches so workers can sit comfortably while working.","Mechanical structures break down and require replacement components. Don't build things you don't need.","Be careful what you construct on bridges. Bridges collapse easily under explosions, and your buildings will go with them.","Clean rooms increase research speed, improve medical outcomes, and reduce food poisoning. Sterile tiles make rooms extra-clean.","Building your whole colony in one structure saves resources, but also makes it difficult to contain fires.","Terrain affects movement speed. Build floors to help your colonists get around quicker.","Different terrain has different inherent cleanliness levels. Tiles are inherently clean; dirt is inherently dirty.","Some floor types are faster to clean than others. It takes much longer to clean carpet compared to metal tile.","You can give prisoners as gifts. Giving a prisoner back to their own faction will be highly appreciated.","You can request specific types of trade caravans using the comms console.","You can use transport pods to send gifts directly to other factions' bases - even your enemies. This improves faction relations.","Keeping prisoners together saves space. However, prisoners kept together will try to break out together.","Enemy faction bases are very well-defended. You don't need to attack them - but be well-prepared if you choose to try.","Cute tame animals will nuzzle your colonists, improving their mood.","Assign your herbivorous animals to areas with lots of grass. They'll eat the grass and spare you the need to feed them.","If someone has a serious infection in a limb, you can remove the limb to save their life.","Sloshing through water makes people unhappy. Build a bridge when you can.","Luciferium can heal scars - even those on the eye or brain. It is, however, a permanent commitment.","Work and movement speed are affected by lighting. Everything is slower in the dark.","Deep underground caverns have a naturally stable temperature, even if it's very hot or cold outside.","Mountain bases are easy to defend. The downside is that people go crazy spending too long underground. And giant insects.","Prisoners will join much quicker and attempt fewer breakouts when they're in a good mood.","You can have multiple researchers working simultaneously at multiple research tables.","Geysers heat up rooms if enclosed. This can be dangerous, or useful.","Explosions extinguish fires in their blast radius. This makes artillery shells useful for stopping fires when there is no other choice.","Even serious setbacks don't mean the game has to end. Try playing out a lost battle - often the best stories come from the darkest situations.","Keep weapon stockpiles away from your prisons. Prison breaks are much more dangerous with guns and explosives.","When taming animals, make sure you have enough food of the correct type to feed them.","Dropping a stone or slag chunk in a doorway will force it open, leaving you vulnerable to hostile wildlife and raiders.","Clean labs with sterile tile give research speed bonuses.","You can change storyteller and playstyle at any time through the options menu.","The more factions you are allied with, the more random traders and military aid you will receive.","You can use drug policies to have your fighters carry combat drugs like go-juice. A quick dose at the start of combat can win the battle.","Set schedules with long stretches of one activity to minimize travel time.","Straw matting ignores filth. Use it as the floor for your barn.","Some animals produce a lot of filth. Keep your elephants and cattle outside.","Predators won't hunt animals which are on the other side of fences or barricades.","It’s never game over. If everyone is dead or gone, you can create new wanderers to take over the remains of your colony.","Store books in bookcases. This increases the beauty of a room, makes nearby research benches faster, and increases the XP and recreation gained from reading.","Want a newly crafted item to be taken to a specific shelf? Once a shelf is named or linked with other shelves, it will appear as a hauling destination in the bill’s “Details…” window.","You can change to a 12 hour clock, or change Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit, in the options menu.","When targeting a colonist with an ability or item, you can also target their portrait in the top colonist
